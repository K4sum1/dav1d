Module Name:

    pushlock.c

Abstract:

    This module houses routines that do push locking.

    Push locks are capable of being acquired in both shared and exclusive mode.

    Properties include:

    They can not be acquired recursively.
    They are small (the size of a pointer) and can be used when embeded in pagable data.
    Acquire and release is done lock free. On lock contention the waiters are chained
    through the lock and local stack space.

    This is the structure of a push lock:


    E  == Exclusive bit
    W  == Waiters present
    SC == Share count
    P  == Pointer to wait block
    +----------+---+---+
    |    SC    | E | W | E, W are single bits W == 0
    +----------+---+---+

    +--------------+---+
    |      P       | W | W == 1. Pointer is the address of a chain of stack local wait blocks
    +--------------+---+

    The non-contented acquires and releases are trivial. Interlocked operations make the following
    transformations.

    (SC=0,E=0,W=0) === Exclusive acquire ===> (SC=0,E=1,W=0)
    (SC=n,E=0,W=0) === Shared acquire    ===> (SC=n+1,E=0,W=0)

    (SC=0,E=1,W=0) === Exclusive release ===> (SC=0,E=0,W=0)
    (SC=n,E=0,W=0) === Shared release    ===> (SC=n-1,E=0,W=0) n > 0

    Contention causes the acquiring thread to produce a local stack based wait block and to
    enqueue it to the front of the list.

    (SC=n,E=e,W=0) === Exclusive acquire ===> (P=LWB(SSC=n,E=e),W=1) LWB = local wait block,
                                                                     SSC = Saved share count,
                                                                     n > 0 or e == 1.

    (SC=0,E=1,W=0) === Shared acquire    ===> (P=LWB(SSC=0,E=0),W=1) LWB = local wait block,
                                                                     SSC = Saved share count.

    After contention has causes one or more threads to queue up wait blocks releases are more
    complicated. This following rights are granted to a releasing thread (shared or exclusive).

    1) Shared release threads are allowed to search the wait list until they hit a wait block
       with a non-zero share count (this will be a wait block marked exclusive). This thread is
       allowed to use an interlocked operation to decrement this value. If this thread
       transitioned the value to zero then it obtains the rights of an exclusive release thread

    2) Exclusive threads are allowed to search the wait list until they find a continuous chain
       of shared wait blocks or they find the last wait block is an exclusive waiter. This thread
       may then break the chain at this point or update the header to show a single exclusive
       owner or multiple shared owners. Breaking the list can be done with normal assignment
       but updating the header requires interlocked exchange compare.
